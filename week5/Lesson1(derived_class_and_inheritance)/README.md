# Derived Class and Inheritance
## Inheritance
new Class B is similar to Class A, or Class B has all the features of Class A. Now we can write Class A is *Base Class*,
and Class B is *Derived Class*.
* Derived Class has all the features of base class. Derived class can be extended and it can modify (overwrite) the base class
  member functions
* Derived Class can be used independent of base class
* Derived Class has all the member variables, private, protected, public...
  - The member functions in derived class can't call the private member variables in base class

```
class Derived class name: public base Class
{
};
```
Example:
```
class CStudent{
private:
    string sName;
    int nAge;
public:
    bool IsThreeGood(){ };
    void SetName(const string &name){
        sName = name;
    }
    
};

class CUndergraduateStudent:public CStudent{
private:
    int nDepartment;
public:
    bool IsThreeGood(){}; // overwrite
    bool CanBaoYan(){};
};

class CGraduatedStudent: public CStudent{
private:
    int nDepartment;
    char szMentorName[20];
public:
    int CountSalary(){};
};
```
