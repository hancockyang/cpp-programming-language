**const
*Part 1: const pointer. Itself can't be changed. The pointed object can be changed. It can pointer to a different object.
*Part 2: const pointer (conted). const point can't point to the object the normal pointer points (can't change the object the const pointer points). But the opposite is correct.
*Part 3: use const pointer to avoid the unwanted change in a function
*Part 4: can't change const reference directly. but can change the object referred to by const &.
